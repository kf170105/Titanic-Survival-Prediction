# Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning)

Project purpose: To predict whether each passenger is survived or not from the titanic disaster using different models going through ML workflow
Project target: To find out the best model in predicting survival condition of each passenger

**Model used:** logistic regression, Random Forest
**Tool used:** Jupyter Notebook, Python, Streamlit
**Imported libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, train_test_split, LogisticRegression, accuracy_score
