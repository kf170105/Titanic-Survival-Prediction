# Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning)

***Project purpose:*** To predict whether each passenger is survived or not from the titanic disaster using different models going through ML workflow

***Project target:*** To find out the best model in predicting survival condition of each passenger


**Model used:** logistic regression, Random Forest 

**Tool used:** Jupyter Notebook, Python, Streamlit

**Imported libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, train_test_split, LogisticRegression, accuracy_score, StandardScaler, RandomForestClassifier, cross_val_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
